# ui5-cap-fullstack-typescript-yo
Showcase of a TypeScript setup for developing UI5 applications (Frontend) + SAP CAP (Backend) and the initial setup was done with a Yeoman Generator.

## UI5 TypeScript setup for Master-Detail pages

You can find the setup for a more "complex" example, that uses UI5 TypeScript with an App that contains Master-Detail pages (list of items with an detail page eacht), on the following branch [ui5-complex-example](https://github.com/Mischa1610/ui5-cap-fullstack-typescript-yo/tree/feature/ui5-complex-example)

<b>TO BE CONTINUED ... I will later add an Fullstack example that covers UI5 and CAP both with TypeScript</b>
